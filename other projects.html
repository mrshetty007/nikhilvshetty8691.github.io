                <p class="project-description">This dashboard was all about new asset registration 

                    Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for the Exception 1.0 process, enhancing the IT Asset Management (ITAM) team's ability to monitor and analyze shipped orders not registered in Atos ServiceNow. This dashboard consolidates data from procurement reports, tracking critical GL accounts such as HPLT, SDLT, and MBPR. It provides real-time insights into asset registration status, procurement discrepancies, and root cause analyses. Utilizing dynamic visualizations, the dashboard facilitates weekly report generation, detailing items like laptops, desktops, and printers. It includes interactive features for drill-down analyses, enabling ITAM to investigate unregistered assets efficiently. By integrating data from the EHI tracker and vendor queries, the dashboard ensures accurate and timely asset creation in ServiceNow. The solution has significantly streamlined the exception management process, leading to improved data quality and operational efficiency within the ITAM team.</p>

                <div class="project-title">Project 2: 3.0 Exception Dashboard</div>
                <p class="project-description">Created a detailed Power BI dashboard for the Exception 3.0 process to enhance IT Asset Management (ITAM) efficiency by identifying assets with an "Install Status" of "1" (In use) that have been inactive for more than 60 days but less than 90 days. This monthly dashboard filters data from the DSS-1 report, ensuring accuracy by applying criteria such as active network status and valid IP addresses. Key attributes include reporting period, last audit date, and IP address verification. The dashboard reconciles data against all other exception reports, depot receipts, and EPC return reports, while excluding specific asset types and certain groups. The dynamic visualizations streamline the identification and management of assets requiring status updates. This tool facilitates timely report generation, enabling ITAM to submit the final report for EHI review and feedback within five business days. By integrating customer feedback and automating asset status notifications to the billing team, the dashboard significantly improves the accuracy of the preliminary billing report. This project has optimized the monthly reporting process, ensuring precise tracking and management of IT assets.

                <div class="project-title">Project 3: 4.0 Exception Dashboard</div>
                <p class="project-description">Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for the Exception 4.0 process, aimed at validating key asset data elements and identifying discrepancies. This monthly report, generated on the first working day of each month, scrutinizes data elements such as asset tags, purchase dates, cost centers, and email addresses to ensure compliance with predefined criteria. The dashboard highlights assets with incorrect values based on a detailed validation process, including checks against the hardware roadmap and procurement reports. It facilitates the recovery and correction of missing or incorrect data within five business days through collaborative review meetings with EHI. The dashboard also automates notifications to the billing team regarding changes in asset statuses, ensuring accurate billing. Additionally, it includes a root cause analysis feature to identify and address recurring data issues, enhancing overall data integrity. This Power BI project significantly streamlines the management of IT assets, providing clear visual insights and actionable intelligence to maintain data accuracy and compliance.

                <div class="project-title">Project 4:2.3 Exception dashboard</div>
                <p class="project-description">Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for the Exception 2.3 process, focusing on identifying network devices not in use but still active. This monthly report, generated on the 20th of each month, examines devices with mismatched statuses, ensuring compliance with predefined conditions. The dashboard filters out specific statuses, DNA values, and depot IPs, and integrates data from network reports to verify attributes like primary user, location, and cost center. It enables the ITAM team to investigate and correct data discrepancies within five business days through collaboration with EHI. The dashboard automates notifications to the billing team regarding changes in device statuses, ensuring accurate billing adjustments. Additionally, it includes a root cause analysis feature to understand and mitigate recurring data issues. This Power BI project enhances IT asset management by providing clear visual insights and actionable intelligence, improving data accuracy and compliance.</p>
